# Getting started
We use a private npm package to create out company interfaces, [Design System](https://github.com/orgs/PayConstruct/packages?repo_name=design-system), in order to use private packages you need to be authenticated.

1. Create a GitHub PAT(Personal Access Token), you **only need read/write packages permission** nothing else
2. Edit you global .npmrc file to include github as a registry with you new generated PAT.
3. Add this to you file, **you don't need to remove what you already have there**, just add this on top:
```
registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
@payconstruct:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_NEW_PAT_HERE
```
**Without this, you can not pull from private packages, be sure to follow the above steps**
